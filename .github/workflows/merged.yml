    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Run latest-tag
      if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
      uses: EndBug/latest-tag@latest
      with:
        # You can change the name of the tag or branch with this input.
        # Default: 'latest'
        ref: latest

        # If a description is provided, the action will use it to create an annotated tag. If none is given, the action will create a lightweight tag.
        # Default: ''
        # description: Description for the tag

        # Force-update a branch instead of using a tag.
        # Default: false
        # force-branch: tru
